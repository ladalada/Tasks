### Finding the coordinates of the isosceles largest area triangle

**Input data**

Input files contain data on the coordinates of the vertices of the triangles on the plane. 
The data is written in a line in the form of 6 consecutive integers, separated by a space 
(each line of the file is a new set of triangle coordinates). 
The first 2 numbers are the coordinates of the first point, the second - the second, etc.

**Output data**

The result of the program is a new file with coordinates in the format of the input file, 
which will contain the coordinates of the vertices of the largest isosceles triangle in the input file 
or empty if there are no such triangles.

**Program launch**

Program parameters are set when the program starts through command line arguments, in order:
1. The name of the input file, required;
2. The name of the output file, required.
